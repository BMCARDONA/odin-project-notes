# My Notes from The Odin Project
## Left off at: 
  - Javascript 
      - ES6 Modules
        - Webpack

## Useful Tools:
  - ([Prettier](https://prettier.io/playground/)) 
    - Prettier is an opinionated code formatter
  - ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/))
    - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
  - ([JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/))
    - JSONLint is a validator and reformatter for JSON, a lightweight data-interchange format.
  - ([Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader))
    -  Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
  - ([JSONFormatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#))
    - The JSON Formatter was created to help folks with debugging. As JSON data is often output without line breaks to save space, it can be extremely difficult to actually read and make sense of it. This tool hoped to solve the problem by formatting and beautifying the JSON data so that it is easy to read and debug by human beings.
